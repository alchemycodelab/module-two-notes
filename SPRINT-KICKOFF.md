# Spring Week Kickoff

## Manage access

Here's how you can add people as collaborators to your project. This way, they can make PRs to the group repo.

You'll also want to create a new organization for supabase and invite everybody to it.

## Branch protection rules

Here's how you can protect your `main` branch from unruly 'cowboy coding'. If you set up these rules, you cannot push directly to main, and you cannot merge a PR without at least 3 approvals.1

# Team Questions
1) What is our collaboration plan? How will we decide which features make it into the app? How will we organize and prioritize features? Will we use Miro, or some other group collaboration tool? How will we decide who works on what feature? How will we decide which features are best for mob or pair or individual work? How will we merge code into the main branch? What is our code review process?
2) What will we do when a conflict comes up? When do we decide to ask for outside help?
3) How will we make sure that we do not reproduce in this sprint group the patterns that have historically excluded people from marginalized groups from feeling safe, seen, and valued in tech work?
4) Given that the best projects are generally produced by the teams who have the most fun, how can we 'keep it light'? What can we do to make sure we look back fondly on this special week? When will we hold our code-free feelings check-ins?
5) What tables need to be set up in supabase? What properties do they need? Do any of these tables have relationships to one another? If so, what are the foreign and primary keys? Plan all of this out before building the tables in supabase.
6) What problems do you anticipte running into in your third-party APIs? Be sure everybody has played with the API and that you can get the data that you think you can get.
