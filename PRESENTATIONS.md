## Presentation Guidelines

Shoot for 20 minutes per team.

### General notes
- Code freeze, then practice your demo.
  - Avoid last minute pushes
  - Practice on your deployed version, not localhost
- Do not point out what you _didn't_ finish. Only tell us what you _did_.
- Be positive and entusiastic. 
- You __are not__ here to showcase how smart you are. 
  - I mean, sure, a little, but just be careful.
- You __are__ here to show to prospective employers _how cool it would be to have you on a team_.
- Give credit. Congratulate your teammates on their contributions.
- Have a shared zoom background so that the audience knows who's on the team.

### Intros (~1 minutes)
- Each teammate says their name and hi
- Perhaps everybody delivers some domain specific tidbit to set the tone.
  - If it's a cooking app, maybe tell the audience your favorite recipe. 
  - If it's a chess app, maybe tell the audience a chess history factoid.
- Traditionally at Alchemy people say 'and I'm a software engineer' or whatever. 
    - Not sure that's a great idea since, like, it feels weird when everybody says the same thing, 
    - Buuuut it tends to be what everybody does, so maybe just do it? ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

### Product talk (~5 minutes)
- Typically, a single team member speaks during this entire section. A second team member screen shares and drives through the app.
- Non-technical. No code. Target audience is product managers and other stakeholders.
- Show only deployed work. No localhost.
- Take users on a tour of your app, perhaps role-playing as a potential user
- Explain the value this app creates, problems it solves
- Briefly showcase major features by using the app
- Practice the 'golden path'
- Invite audience to use the app.

### Tech talk (~10 minutes)
- Technical details. Show code and assume an audience of developers.
- Do not read code aloud. Tell the story of your app through code. 
   - Nobody wants to hear you read your `for` loop out loud.
- Keep one driver throughout. However, every member of the group will speak, one by one.
- Each team member selects one feature, one file, or one interesting function and presents on it.
  - (Optional) In the browser, briefly remind the audience how the feature/functionality you're describing looks in the app.
  - Show the code and describe in general terms why it's interesting.
  - What interesting problems did you run into?
  - What did you learn?
  - What advice do you have for anybody else facing this task?

### Conclusion (~2 minutes)
- One by one, remind the audience who you are.
- Maybe give the audience a quick: 
  - What did you like about working with this group? 
  - or What did you learn?

### Questions (~2 minutes)
- Prepare for:
  - If you had one more week, what would you have added?
  - What was the most interesting bug you ran into?
  - What was your favorite part about this week?
  - What was harder than you thought it would be?
  - What was easier than you though it would be?
- "We chose focus our efforts elsewhere"
- You can ask for clarification
- No snowing--be direct and concise! It's okay not to know the answer :)
